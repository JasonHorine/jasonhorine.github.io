      </a>
      <p>The Good Whiskers site is a crowd-sourced beard product database.  The site is my team's deliverable for an assignment to create and depoly a full-stack Rails in about 4.5 days' coding.  This was week six in General Assembly Web Development Immersive course.</p>
      <ul>Requirements of the assignment:
        <li>-Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app</li>
        <li>-Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow</li>
        <li>-Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE</li>
        <li>-Utilize an ORM (ActiveRecord) to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data</li>
        <li>-Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process</li>
        <li>-Have semantically clean HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>-Be deployed online and accessible to the public</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a group, we neglected to plan ahead on the overall look of the site and to set aside sufficient time for styling.  For about four days worth of coding, we generally liked what we were able to throw together.  To see what I did specifically on this project, please click my GitHub link on the home page.</p>
      <p>Feel free to sign in and comment on or add some beard products!</p>
