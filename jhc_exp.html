      <p>This site was styled after an ad I saw for a local coding meetup.  Their site was just red and white blocks if I recall correctly.  I loved the simple, geometric, mobile-first look of it.  I also appreciated that it dared to ignore the white-space race and giant background photography that are so common among the popular templates.  Its focus was functionality.</p>
      <p>I used no framework or template, excluding the slider under UX.  The sizing of the blocks is accomplished using Flex and media queries.  It's all open to see in my GitHub repo if you're interested.</p>
      <ul><h3>My colors:</h3>
        <li>Gold and Green are from the US Army, where I first stepped into the Tech field.  Army Yellow:FFCB05 Army Green:7B8738</li>
        <li>Navy is from the flag of Kentucky, where I grew up. Navy:000080</li>
        <li>Red is from the flag of Texas.  My wife and daughter were born in Texas.  They are back home, and I love it here.  I also arranged the blocks so the blue red and white would be reminiscent of the Texas flag at wider screen widths.  Red:F51E1E</li>
        <li>Black and White appear in all the above.</li>
      </ul>
