# My homepage
## Inspiration for the look

An ad for a local meetup inspired me to do this.  I really appreciated the elegant simplicity of it and its focus on mobile-friendly functionality. It also reminds me of a design on the front of the Whole Foods building at William Cannon and Mopac.  Their design is a version of their private label logo, having a colored square for each season.

## Responsivness

I really wanted a site that viewed well on mobile.  I don't know if I'd say it was designed mobile-first.  If mobile-simultaneous were a thing, thats the label I'd use for my process here.  :)

The site uses no templates for responsiveness, just my CSS.  There are two media queries.  There was an issue with the appearance on mobile devices that vexed me for some time.  I finally figured out that it was due to using DNS forwarding with masking.  Go Daddy wraps the site in an iframe to mask the URL.  The iframe prevented the browser from responding to the scaled screen size of mobile, if I understand it correctly.  I turned off masking to fix it.  

## Suggetions

If you have any suggestions, by all means email them to me.  I did have a concern about not making something more up to the moment with web trends.  (big image backgrounds that scroll away to reveal white space)  Hey, maybe I'm ahead of the curve!
