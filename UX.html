  <p class="big_quote">The psychology behind a great user interface is what I love most about UX design… not what the user is thinking, buy why they are thinking it, why they are in front of your product at all.</p>

    <p class="project_text text_left">This brief video gives an overview of my most recent project. This is a wireframe of a completely re-imagined front end for a Programmable Logic Controller's (PLC) System Configuration. This project is still underway, so there is no final image to show. The video presentation explains the process for designing this particular interface.</p>

    <p class="project_text text_right">This is the search results display in a PLC. A project in this programming software has many layers, so displaying results is much more complex than on a flat document such as a PDF. I used a familiar tree structure to categorize the search results. The user can quickly and intuitively find the search result in context. They can also easily hide large sets of results to quickly narrow the scope.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="big_quote">Done right, the interface feels to the user like an extension of their thoughts, using it is just a natural progression towards the goal at hand. When the user interface can fade into the user’s subconcsious mind, it is spot on.</p>
