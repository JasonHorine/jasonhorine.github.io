A project in this programming software has many layers, so displaying results is much more complex than on a flat document such as a word processor or other text editor. I used a familiar tree structure to categorize the search results. The user can quickly and intuitively find the search results in context. They can also easily hide large sets of results to focus the scope.</p>
