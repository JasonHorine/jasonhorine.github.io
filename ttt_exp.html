      </a>
      <p>The HTML and CSS for the Tic Tac Toe game are very simple.  The game is my deliverable for a JavaScript weekend homework assignment just two weeks into General Assembly's Web Immersive program.  My personal goal was to build a game to run on smart phones.  I especially wanted it to run well on old hand-me-down hardware, such as those kids are more likely to have at hand.</p>
      <p><strong>Except for three lines of CSS, the code is as I wrote it then.</strong>  The CSS changes corrected a frustrating issue I couldn't get past at the time.  I had plans for more functionality but had to trim back to have a working MVP, which you can see in the code.</p>
      <ul><h3>Some features:</h3>
        <li>Players take turns starting the game.</li>
        <li>Once complete, clicking the board anywhere clears it.</li>
        <li>The 'Your Turn!' arrow intuitively facilitates two players sitting side-by-side sharing the phone.</li>
      </ul>
